## Rev 1 Assembly Notes

The following notes refer to [mech_rev1](https://github.com/Gigahawk/mech423_final_project/tree/mech_rev1/mech) (commit hash a887341).

- Thread features work smoothly
- LED strip clamp could be better designed currently the clamping force is transmitted through hot glue covering the LED strip solder joints
- Wall thickness is insufficient in many areas
    - Some areas are unfixable, like screw holes
- Screw holes are unnecessary
    - Sandwich mount works fine with just the collars holding the pieces together
